## Business Interpretation & Recommendations
Insight 1 = Engagement problem 
1)Insight:
Most low-value customers churn within 7 days because interact with only one product category and show low engagement beyond their first order.

Why this is happening (data-backed reasoning):
Customer-level analysis shows churned users have significantly fewer product interactions and category diversity compared to retained customers.

Business Decision:
Improve early-stage product discovery instead of relying on discounts to drive repeat purchases.

Action:
Introduce personalized product recommendations and category highlights within the first week after purchase, focusing on related or complementary products.

Expected Impact:
Increasing product discovery could improve repeat purchase rates by 5–8%, leading to higher customer lifetime value without additional acquisition spend


Insight 2 — Country imbalance

Insight:
Revenue is heavily concentrated in one country, while other countries show lower repeat rates and contribution.

Why (data-backed):
Customer cohorts outside the dominant country have lower order frequency and higher early churn within the first 30 days.

Business Decision:
Adopt an ROI-driven international strategy instead of equal expansion.

Action:
Focus marketing and retention efforts on the dominant country and run controlled experiments in one secondary country.

Expected Impact:
Improved marketing ROI and reduced wasted spend in low-performing regions.


🔹 Insight 3 — Monetary problem

Insight:
Customers with low first-order value are significantly more likely to churn.

Why (data-backed):
Data shows repeat customers have higher initial order value compared to churned users.

Business Decision:
Increase first-order value to improve long-term retention.

Action:
Introduce bundles or minimum-order incentives for first-time buyers.

Expected Impact:
Higher initial engagement leading to increased repeat purchase probability.
